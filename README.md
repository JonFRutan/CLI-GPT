### CLI-GPT
CLI-GPT is a simple command-line frontend for using OpenAI's API.  
OpenAI's API is quite a bit more powerful than the standard ChatGPT frontend, allowing more customization to the model and fine control over generation aspects.  
The goal of CLI-GPT is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for using and customizing OpenAI's API all from your terminal.
