## CLI-GPT
CLI-GPT is a simple command-line frontend for using OpenAI's API.  
OpenAI's API is quite a bit more powerful than the standard ChatGPT frontend, allowing more customization to the model and fine control over generation aspects.  
The goal of CLI-GPT is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for using and customizing OpenAI's API all from your terminal, useful for devices without a windowing system installed.
##### Setup:
Using this program requires an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/) (not to be confused with a ChatGPT account), and will require an API key which can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). This requires you add some funds to the account in order to qualify for making API calls.  
*Using gpt-4o-mini, my cumulative API calls have not even amounted to 1 cent. My use is generally restricted to testing the program though.*  
Once downloaded, simply run ```python cli.py```  
If you run into any problems, please reach out to me or create an issue.
