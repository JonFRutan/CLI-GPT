## CLI-GPT
CLI-GPT is a simple command-line frontend for using OpenAI's API.  
OpenAI's API is quite a bit more powerful than the standard ChatGPT frontend, allowing more customization to the model and fine control over generation aspects.  
The goal of CLI-GPT is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for using and customizing OpenAI's API all from your terminal, useful for devices without a windowing system installed.
##### Prerequisites:
Using this program requires an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/) (not to be confused with a ChatGPT account), and will require an API key which can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).  
*Using gpt-4o-mini, my cumulative API calls have not even amounted to 1 cent. The longer the generations, power of the model, and actions being done will affect this pricing.*  
##### To Do:
- Settings persistence
- Image Generation
- Image/File upload
- Chats
